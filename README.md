# Gateway D
## A simpler gateway to DeFi

### Less is More
Defi apps today are overwhelming for most people. Too much jargon and zero guidance on how to get started. I've seen too many front ends leaving me confused about whether the transaction went through.


I'd like to build a beginner's defi wallet with..
-limited options to only the most reputable defi protocols
-front end organized by benefits the user will get, not defi protocol names - People don't know what Aave & Compound are but they know what it means to earn interest. 
-a user experience that's intuitive and aided by clear guidance on what's happening now and what to do next

This way, non-cryptopians can access defi without worrying about getting scammed the most common way: losing keys or funds through phishing sites.

If the benefits are clear and it's easy to use, I think it can help a lot of people dip their toes into defi.
